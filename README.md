# E-State Accelerator 🚀

## Bridging the “Execution Gap” in Administration of Digital Assets

The E-State Accelerator is an Innovation Lab project at Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, in partnership with LexShift LLC. Our mission is to solve the "Execution Gap"—a systemic failure where technical security controls and restrictive custodian policies obstruct fiduciaries from exercising their legal authority to settle estates involving digital assets.

## 📋 The Mission

To build a prototype toolset that operationalizes legal authority into the ability to act. We aim to transform a process currently defined by protracted administrative friction and technical lockouts into a streamlined, code-driven workflow.

## 🏛 The Challenge

Modern estate administration is unequipped for a cloud-first world. Executors face an "administrative maze" of:

- **The Discovery Gap:** Locating assets without physical paper trails.

- **The Privacy Hurdle:** Navigating "lawful consent" under federal privacy laws (SCA/ECPA).

- **The Continuity Risk:** Maintaining invisible business infrastructure (SaaS/Stripe/AWS).

- **The Execution Gap:** Converting a valid court order into actual technical access through 2FA, biometric locks, and encryption.

## 🛠 Project Scope

Students will explore solutions such as:

1. **The Probate Dashboard:** A B2B interface for broadcasting verified legal credentials to custodians.

2. **The Compliance Handshake:** Guided workflows for the inheritance protocols of major providers (Apple, Google, Meta, etc.).

3. **The "TurboTax" for Estates:** An interview-driven expert system codifying federal, state, and commercial rules for estate wind-down.

## 📚 Key Legal & Technical Frameworks

- **RUFADAA:** Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act.

- **SCA / ECPA:** Stored Communications Act / Electronic Communications Privacy Act.

- **CFAA:** Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

- **Custodian TOS:** Platform-specific Terms of Service.
